<h1>Network Security Home Lab</h1>

This repository showcases my network security home labs, which include a variety of practical hands on experiments, labs, and write ups involving various topics in network security. Labs are ran on a virtual machine to safely simulate attacks, defences, and monitoring without touching any actual systems.
